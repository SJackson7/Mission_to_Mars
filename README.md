### Mission to Mars!

For this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the planet Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following information outlines what I did to create this application.

The webpage consists of scraped data from the websites below using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Request/Splinter and Python languages. The webpage presents a button to retrieve the data using Flask, thus launching the scrape_mars.py file that goes to each of the necessary websites. This information is collected, displayed, and stored in a Mongo database for future retrieval if necessary.

The following sites were scraped to obtain the final webpage and screenshot of the final product are below.
